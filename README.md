Book Safari is a React-Redux CRUD project that I've created as part of my requirements for Flatiron School's web development curriculum. The app, which consists of a React-Redux front end with a Rails API backend, allows users to look up information on books via a search tool (powered by Google Books API) and create reading log entries. The intended users would be young students (probably elementary/middle school age). 

(At this stage, I am still working out some kinks with the edit and delete functions with the reading log section. In addition, I plan to improve the styling.)
